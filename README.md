# Dynamic Controller
Dynamic Controller is contoller class designed to simplify the creation of CRUD operations for any data model in your application. Instead of writing seprate controllers for each model, you only need to create this one controller and reuse it by passing diffrent models as arguments.

The controller methods(index,show,store, update and delete) are generic and work for any model thay follows the standard Mongoose API.

## Fuck, it so fucking text book bro!
### Here the summary
>  Dynamic Controller is all about not repeating yourself. You just write your CRUD functions once, and then use them for any model by passing it in. It makes things cleaner and you donâ€™t have to keep copying and pasting the same logic for different models.
